### COVID-19 Global Data Trends From 2021 to Early 2022

#### About
As we begin to enter the early months of 2022 and finally see some alleviation from the COVID-19 pandemic, I thought that it might be informative to reflect on how the pandemic has impacted the world over the past year. In this analysis specifically, I chose to further investigate the cases and deaths relative to a country's population.

The dataset I will be using for my analysis is available on [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

#### Preparation
The dataset was first cleaned and filtered on Microsoft Excel.

#### Analysis
The SQL queries I used can be found [here](https://github.com/khaitmb/Global-Covid-Data/blob/main/SQL_Queries.sql).

#### Share
For my data visualization, I chose to focus on infection rates by time and location. I summarized these trends in a dashboard on Tableau.
